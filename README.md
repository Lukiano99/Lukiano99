## Hi, I'm Luka Stojadinovic! üëã

I'm a passionate **full-stack developer** with a deep focus on **Next.js**, building modern, scalable web applications. I love creating clean, efficient, and well-documented code. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me jamming on my guitar or hitting the gym!

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### üìö What I'm Up To
I actively document my projects and regularly push my code to GitHub. My focus is on **next-gen web technologies**, and I‚Äôm always exploring new frameworks and improving my current stack. My journey also involves continuous learning in **CMS systems** like **Payload**, to extend my expertise.

### üë• Teamwork & Experience
I've had the opportunity to work in a team of 20+ developers, including smaller groups of up to 5 people. I‚Äôve collaborated closely with designers, PMs, and backend/frontend developers, which has helped me refine both my technical and communication skills. Full-stack development is my passion, and I enjoy building features end-to-end, from database design to frontend user experiences.

### üé∏ Fun Facts

- Fitness is a big part of my life. I'm dedicated to improving both mentally and physically, and you can often find me at the gym or reading a good book.
